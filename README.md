# Machine_Learning

### 1. This project intends to implement how gradient descent works in Linear and Logistic regression. 
### 2. We tune the hyperparameters i.e. learning rate and number of iterations to get the m.aximum accuracy.
### 3. The data set is picked from UCI repository named 'SGEMM GPU kernel performance Data Set' and 'Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set Data Set' for regression and classification algorithms.
