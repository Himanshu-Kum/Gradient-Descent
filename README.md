# Machine_Learning

#### 1. This project intends to implement how gradient descent works in Linear regression and Logistic regression.
#### 2. We tune the hyperparameters i.e. learning rate and number of iterations to get the maximum accuracy.
#### 3. The data set is picked from UCI repository named 'SGEMM GPU kernel performance Data Set' and 'Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set Data Set' for regression and classification algorithms.
